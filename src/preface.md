# Preface

These are notes for the course **CAS CS 320: Principles of Programming Languages (Spring 2024)** taught at Boston University.
They are based on material created by several members of the *Principles of Programming and Verification (POPV)* group, perhaps most notably Marco Gaboardi and Hongwei Xi.

CS 320 has recently been taught in two parts.
The first part is on the basics of OCaml, using the now mainstay text [OCaml Programming: Correct + Efficient + Beautiful](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/cover.html) by Michael R. Clarkson.
During the second part, students learn the fundamentals necessary to build an interpreter.
This part of the course has no base text, in part because material on the topic tends to go into either too much or too little detail.
These notes attempt to fill this gap, and to give students of the course a reference for the second part of the course.

This year (Spring 2024) is the first year we are using these notes.
This is to say: **they are incredibly incredibly rough.**
There are likely rife with typos, humorous misspellings and grammatical errors, poorly written sections, missing explanations, and the like.
To students: we appreciate your (assumed) patience.
To everyone: any comments are welcome.
If you spot a error, you are encouraged to post an issue to the associated [GitHub repository]()

These notes are generated using [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).
